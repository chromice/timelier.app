# Kickass

Asset building pipeline.

## Before you run tasks

You need to setup all local packages:

    [sudo] npm install

You may need to install Gulp globally:

    [sudo] npm install -g gulp

## Running tasks

Build everything:

    gulp build

Or:

    gulp build:styles
    gulp build:scripts

Build automatically (with livereload):

    gulp watch

Happy building!
